**Welcome to EmotionalOS v2.5 â€” The Emotional Kernel Expansion.**

EmotionalOS has now evolved into the first **emotional operating platform** designed to heal, lead, and empower through emotional sovereignty. We are no longer just a guide for individual transformation â€” we are creating a platform to collectively heal and grow together.

- **Creative Works** that document the emotional journey and wisdom gained from surviving.
- **Field Prompts** that serve as daily reminders and questions to help you stay aligned with EmotionalOS principles.
- **Research Papers** exploring the deeper connections between emotional intelligence, leadership, and community-building.

**This release is for those who seek more than productivity â€” it's for those who seek depth, healing, and collective emotional liberation.**
