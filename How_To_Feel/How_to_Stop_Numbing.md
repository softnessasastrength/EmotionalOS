# How to Stop Numbing

1. Identify the substance—or substitute.
2. Ask what you’re *avoiding*—that’s the root.
3. Sit in discomfort. It won’t kill you. It’ll *reveal* you.
4. Replace escape with expression. Cry. Journal. Scream.
5. Find your people. Feeling alone is what keeps us numb.

You don’t need a vice. You need a witness.
