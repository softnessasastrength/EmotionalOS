# How to Love Without Losing Yourself

1. Keep your rituals. Don’t vanish into them.
2. Make space for solitude *inside* connection.
3. Ask what you want—then ask if you’re living it.
4. Don’t shrink to fit. Expand to love.
5. If you can’t be your full self near them—it’s not love.

Love doesn’t erase. It amplifies.
