# How_To_Love

Love isn’t self-explanatory. It’s a *practice*—one we were never really taught.

This folder is your untraining ground. To break free from control, shame, and co-dependence—and learn love as liberation.

Or send it to someone who never got the memo.

This is not how to love *perfectly*.  
This is how to love *bravely*.
