# How to Forgive Your Past Self

1. Look that version of you in the eye.
2. Say, “You were doing your best with what you knew.”
3. Feel the grief of harm done. Don’t skip that.
4. Choose mercy anyway. You’re not punishing yourself into growth.
5. Bring that self home. You’re one version now—not a war.

You didn’t fail. You *formed*. And now you evolve.
