# How to Love Again After Being Broken

1. Admit that you’re scared—and that’s okay.
2. Don’t seek replacement. Seek *resonance*.
3. Let love earn your trust again—slowly.
4. Don’t armor up. Stay soft, even when you shake.
5. Believe that your tenderness is your strength.

You weren’t broken. You were *opened*.
