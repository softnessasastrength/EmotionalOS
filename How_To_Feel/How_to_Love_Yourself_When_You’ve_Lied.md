# How to Love Yourself When You’ve Lied

1. Face the truth. Fully.
2. Don’t flinch from the pain it caused.
3. Apologize if you can. If not, repair with presence.
4. Choose not to be that version again. Daily.
5. Say it out loud: “Even then, I was worthy of love.”

You’re not just what you did. You’re what you *choose now*.
