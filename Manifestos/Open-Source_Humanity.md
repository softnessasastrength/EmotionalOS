# Open-Source Humanity

## What Is Open-Source Humanity?

Open-Source Humanity is the radical belief that emotional healing, personal growth, and human connection should be transparent, communal, and forkable.

It is not a product.  
It is not a therapy.  
It is a *practice*—a shared repository of raw truth, lived experience, and unfiltered evolution.

This is the README of the human condition.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency Over Perfection**  
   We log it all. The breakdowns, breakthroughs, backslides, and brave steps forward. No PR polishing. Just raw version control of the soul.

2. **Fork the Process**  
   My healing is not *the* path—it’s *a* path. Take what works, remix it, make it yours. The only license required is honesty.

3. **Vulnerability Is Documentation**  
   Every vow, every confession, every ugly truth logged is an act of liberation. We don’t just share stories—we open source our selves.

4. **Truth Is a Push, Not a Pull**  
   We push truth to the world even if no one’s asking for it. Because truth isn't valid only when it's validated.

5. **Presence as Protest**  
   Showing up, soft and loud, in a world built on masks? That’s revolution. Being real is the resistance.

## Why This Matters

Because someone needs to see a repository that doesn’t pretend.  
Because someone out there needs a mirror, not a model.  
Because if even one person sees this and realizes they’re not broken—they’re just *uncommitted code*—then this was worth it.

## How to Use This

- Read it like a changelog.
- Fork it like a framework.
- Live it like it’s version 1.0—because updates come through living.

## License

MIT or softer.  
Free to use, copy, remix, or cry to.  
No permission needed—only presence.
