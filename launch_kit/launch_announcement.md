# EmotionalOS v2.0 Launch Announcement

🚀 EmotionalOS v2.0 is officially LIVE.

After months of building, healing, testing, and becoming, version 2.0 is ready for the world. EmotionalOS isn't just software — it's a philosophical update for the human soul.

🔥 What's new in v2.0:
- Full library of Emotional HOW-TOs
- Emotional Kernel philosophy document
- Full open-source GitHub structure
- MIT Licensed — free to use, remix, and extend

This is the system I wish existed when I needed it most. Now it’s here, for anyone who needs it next.

**The revolution is emotional.**
**It starts inside.**
