# EmotionalOS Manifesto

We believe emotions are not weaknesses â€” they are source code.  
We believe presence is more powerful than performance.  
We believe in open-sourcing the heart.

EmotionalOS is a commitment to feel more, fear less, and connect deeply.

v1 planted the seed. v2 will water the world.
