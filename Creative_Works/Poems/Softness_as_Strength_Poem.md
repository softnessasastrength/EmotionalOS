Softness as Strength

In a world that tells us to harden our hearts,
To rise above, to shield our minds,
We forget the strength that lies in being soft,
In being vulnerable, in being kind.

For softness isn't weakness, nor is it a chain,
It’s the courage to embrace all the joy and pain.
It’s in the tears that flow, the gentle hand,
The quiet voice that says, "I understand."

To be soft is to be real, to let down the walls,
To stand in the open, no fear of the falls.
It’s strength in its purest, most human form,
It’s warmth in the cold, it’s a shelter from storm.

So, let us be soft, and let us be strong,
For in our tenderness, we all belong.
In the embrace of our flaws, we find our grace,
In the softness of love, we make the world a safer place.
