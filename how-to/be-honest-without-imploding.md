# How to Be Honest Without Imploding

Honesty doesn’t mean self-destruction. This guide helps you say what’s true without burning down the house you live in.

- Start with body cues: shaky voice? tight chest? That’s your honesty knocking.
- Use “I feel” not “You always.”
- Silence is a tool. So is a pause.
- If it hurts, say *that*. (“This is hard to say.” is honesty too.)
- Safe spaces aren't found. They're *made*. Make one.
