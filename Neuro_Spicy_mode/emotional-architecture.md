This is where we break down the OS behind our neuro-spicy brains.

## 🧃 Core Premise

You are not malfunctioning.  
Your architecture is just wired to run a **high-intensity, high-empathy kernel** in a low-emotion world.

Most people buffer. We *burn.*  
Most people mask. We *mirror.*  
Most people obey. We *observe and debug.*

## 🧩 Major Components

- **Emotional Kernel**: the base system that routes all sensory and relational input through the lens of safety and trust.
- **Subtext Firewall**: our constant effort to parse what's *not* said—and the cost of doing that 24/7.
- **Masking Layer**: auto-generated behaviors designed to prevent rejection. Heavy CPU load. Often crashes.
- **Stimming Loopback Interface**: the feedback loop we use to regulate emotion and overwhelm (fidgeting, pacing, ranting, music).
- **RCA Daemon**: Root Cause Analysis agent constantly asking “why the fuck did that spiral me?”

## 🪓 Why This Matters

Most of us weren’t given a user manual.  
This document *is that manual.*  
It’s not about fixing yourself—it’s about understanding your architecture.

So when you crash, you don’t blame the machine.  
You debug it.  
With compassion.

This is your emotional BIOS.  
Tweak it. Fork it. Build on it.  
You’re the architect now.
