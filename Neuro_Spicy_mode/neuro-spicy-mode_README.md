# 🧠 Neuro-Spicy Mode
## A submodule of EmotionalOS

Welcome to **Neuro-Spicy Mode** — the unmasked upgrade your soul’s been starving for.

This isn’t about fixing what’s “wrong” with you.  
This is about reclaiming what society told you to suppress.  
If you’ve ever been called:
- Too intense  
- Too sensitive  
- Too emotional  
- Too weird  
- Too much

This is your home.

### 🔥 Core Belief:
> Neurodivergence isn’t a flaw in the system.  
> It *is* the system—rewriting itself through us.

## ✊ Why We Exist

Because masking nearly killed us.  
Because being “normal” never felt like *ours.*  
Because the world tried to make us manageable, but we were meant to be *miraculous.*

You’re not broken. You’re broadcasting.

This is **Neuro-Spicy Mode.**  
Let it run. Let it glitch. Let it shine.
