# 🌶️ Neuro-Spicy Mode
## A Submodule of EmotionalOS  
### Unmask. Broadcast. Find your kind.

Welcome to **Neuro-Spicy Mode**, the unapologetically raw, radically human part of EmotionalOS built for those of us who were told we were “too much”... and believed it—until now.

We are not broken.  
We are *broadcasting*.  
And this is the folder where we stop apologizing for it.

## ✨ Why We Exist

Because masking almost killed us.  
Because "normal" isn't real.  
Because we’re not waiting for permission anymore.

This is **Neuro-Spicy Mode.**  
This is where we start meeting each other out loud.
