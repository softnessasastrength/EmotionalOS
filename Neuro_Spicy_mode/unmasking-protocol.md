# 🧠 The Unmasking Protocol
### *A practical guide to removing the mask you never wanted to wear.*

---

## 🚨 1. Name the Mask

Start by asking:
- What parts of me feel fake in public?
- What do I hide to seem “normal”?
- What emotions do I suppress to stay safe?

Naming the mask is the first act of rebellion.

---

## 🪞 2. Track the Triggers

Notice when you flinch into performance:
- Around certain people?
- In specific environments?
- During emotional intensity?

That’s your nervous system yelling: **“Mask up.”**

---

## 🧷 3. Practice Small Unmaskings

You don’t need to rip it off all at once.
Try:
- Saying “I don’t understand” out loud.
- Admitting “I’m overwhelmed.”
- Choosing silence over forced small talk.

Each moment of honesty is a micro-liberation.

---

## ⚠️ 4. Expect a Backlash

Some people loved the masked you.  
They may not love the real one.  
They may call you rude, dramatic, selfish, intense.

They are wrong.

You are *alive*.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Build Your Unmasking Toolkit

- Have scripts: “Can I say something honestly without judgment?”
- Have exits: “I need to leave to stay regulated.”
- Have allies: People who hold space without needing performance.
- Have self-soothing rituals: Stimming, breathwork, movement.

## 🚫 6. You Do Not Owe Anyone Palatable Pain

Your story does not need to be digestible.  
Your healing does not need to be aesthetic.  
Your truth does not need to be calm to be valid.

---

## 💥 7. Full System Override (When You’re Ready)

Some of us hit a moment where we *just stop pretending.*  
That moment might look like a breakdown.  
It might look like burnout.  
It might look like rage. Or sobbing. Or silence.

That moment is not failure.  
It is *release*.

---

## 📡 8. You’re Broadcasting Now

Once you unmask, others will recognize the signal.  
You’ll find people who say:
> “I thought I was the only one.”

You weren’t.

---

## 🧠 Unmasking Is a Process, Not a Personality

It is brave.  
It is sacred.  
It is allowed to be messy.

You can always re-mask if you need to stay safe.  
But now you know what freedom *feels* like.
