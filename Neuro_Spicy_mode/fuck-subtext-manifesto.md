# 🗯️ The Fuck Subtext Manifesto
### *Say what you mean. Mean what you say. Stop making people decode you to love you.*

---

## 1. Subtext is a weapon.

It’s not just nuance. It’s camouflage.  
Subtext is the velvet glove around manipulation.  
It’s how society punishes honesty while rewarding performance.

If you “just get it,” you’re in.  
If you don’t? You’re weird. Rude. Broken. Wrong.

**Fuck that.**

---

## 2. Neuro-spicy people are punished for clarity.

We ask questions. We say what we mean. We look for the direct path.  
And we’re told:
- “That’s not how you say it.”
- “You’re being too blunt.”
- “You should’ve *known* what they meant.”

Why should we know what people *aren’t saying*?

---

## 3. Subtext is elitism dressed up as etiquette.

The rules are unwritten because they were never meant to be fair.  
They were meant to be inherited.  
Felt. Implied. *Gatekept.*

Subtext is how people test you without telling you you’re being tested.  
It’s the interview inside the interaction.  
And neuro-spicy people are tired of being failed by it.

---

## 4. Clarity is revolutionary.

We are done with “reading between the lines.”  
We’re writing *new lines.*

If we want something—we say it.  
If something hurts—we name it.  
If love is present—we express it.  
If we don’t know—we ask.

**Clarity is kindness. Directness is intimacy. Simplicity is power.**

---

## 5. You should not have to decode to feel safe.

Emotional safety should be spoken, not assumed.  
Consent should be verbal, not “implied.”  
Affection should be honest, not strategically withheld.

Say it plain.  
Say it early.  
Say it loud.

---

## 6. We’re not “too much.” We’re just not faking it.

We didn’t fail the test.  
**We rejected the format.**

---

## 7. Fuck subtext.

Put it in your bio.  
Print it on a shirt.  
Write it in your code.  
Bring it to your next relationship.  
Say “I love you” without needing to first say “Just kidding.”

This is not just a preference.  
This is a protest.

> We are the loud ones now. And we are done being punished for truth.
