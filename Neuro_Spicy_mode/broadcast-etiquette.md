# 📡 Broadcast Etiquette
### How to speak your truth without burning every bridge.

Unmasking doesn’t mean becoming reckless.  
It means being **true** and **intentional** at the same time.

This is how we broadcast with clarity *and* compassion.

---

## 🔊 1. Speak From Signal, Not Static

Before you speak, ask:
- Am I regulated or reactive?
- Am I sharing to connect, or to offload?
- Do I want dialogue, or just to be heard?

Your feelings are valid *and* deserve clean transmission.

---

## 🧘 2. Regulate Before You Radiate

- Breathe. Name your emotion. Ground.
- Don’t weaponize your unmasking.
- Honest ≠ harmful. Clarity ≠ cruelty.

---

## 🧭 3. Set Expectations

Start with:
- “Can I say something honestly?”
- “I don’t need advice, just presence.”
- “This is hard to say, but I’m done hiding it.”

Let others opt in. That’s consent.

---

## 🧠 4. Hold Room for Misfires

Even direct speech can land wrong.
Give yourself grace. Give others time.

Try:
- “Did that come out how I meant it?”
- “I want to try again—can you hear me differently?”

---

## 🫂 5. Mirror Back & Check Impact

- “What did you hear me say?”
- “I want to make sure I didn’t just dump.”
- “Did that feel like an attack, or were you okay with how I said it?”

---

## 🪩 6. You Can Be Raw Without Being Ruinous

You can speak the hardest truth with love.  
You can rage without shrapnel.  
You can scream without erasing someone else’s voice.

Broadcast doesn’t mean bulldoze.  
Unmasked doesn’t mean unaware.

---

## 🌈 Final Note

Say the truth.  
But say it in a way that invites healing, not just catharsis.

**Because we’re not just trying to feel better.  
We’re trying to feel *together*.**
