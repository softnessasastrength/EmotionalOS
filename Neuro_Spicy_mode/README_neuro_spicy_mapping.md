# ðŸ§  Neuro-Spicy Self-Mapping Tool

This is a simple, interactive Python CLI utility that helps you identify your quadrant in the **Neuro-Spicy Alignment Chart**â€”a framework for unmasking emotional truth and understanding your expressive style.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Download the script:
   ```
   wget https://your-link/neuro_spicy_self_mapping.py
   ```

2. Make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x neuro_spicy_self_mapping.py
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./neuro_spicy_self_mapping.py
   ```

Answer the questions honestly. You'll be given:
- Your Emotional Output Style
- Your Social Masking Profile
- Your Neuro-Spicy Alignment (e.g., Volcano Heart, Soft Siren)

Then go to the `alignment-chart.md` to learn more about your quadrant and meet others like you.
