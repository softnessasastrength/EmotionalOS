# 💬 Neuro-Spicy Conversation Scripts
### Because not everyone was raised on subtext.

---

## 🙋 Asking for Clarity

- “Can you be more direct so I don’t misinterpret?”
- “What does that mean to you specifically?”
- “I don’t understand the subtext—can you rephrase it?”

---

## 🛑 Setting a Boundary

- “That doesn’t work for me.”
- “I need a break to process.”
- “I’m not comfortable with that right now.”

---

## 📡 Unmasking In Real-Time

- “Hey, I’m trying to be more honest—this is hard for me.”
- “I usually hide this part of me, but I want to be real with you.”
- “I don’t know how to say this in a ‘normal’ way, but I’ll try anyway.”

---

## 💛 Expressing Emotion Without Apologizing

- “I’m feeling a lot right now and that’s okay.”
- “This isn’t me being dramatic—it’s me being honest.”
- “Please don’t try to fix it, just hold space.”

---

## 🧩 Asking for Support

- “Can you check in with me later?”
- “Can you sit with me while I process this?”
- “Can you mirror back what you’re hearing so I know I’m clear?”

Direct is not rude.  
Clarity is kindness.  
These scripts are not training wheels—they’re *keys to connection*.
