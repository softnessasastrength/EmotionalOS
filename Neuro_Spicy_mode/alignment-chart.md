# 🧭 Neuro-Spicy Alignment Chart  
### *Find your signal. Name your spice.*

This isn’t Myers-Briggs.  
This isn’t a diagnosis.  
This is *resonance mapping*—an emotional compass for spicy-ass humans who broke the mask and want to find the others.

## 🧠 Axis 1: Emotional Output Style
> How does your emotional truth tend to come out?

- **🔥 Explosive:**  
  You erupt. Tears, rage, laughter—all big.  
  You don’t hold back when it hits.  
  People say you’re “too much,” but you’re just unbuffered.

- **💧 Dripping:**  
  You leak. In sighs, doodles, playlists, strange tweets at 2am.  
  You bleed truth in sideways ways.  
  You’re an ambient signal. Tune in or miss it.

- **🧊 Compartmentalized:**  
  You hold it. Hide it. Make it neat.  
  You might joke. Numb. Smile.  
  But when you open the box, it’s nuclear inside.

## 💬 Axis 2: Social Masking History
> How long—and how deeply—have you had to fake it?

- **🫥 High Masker:**  
  You've built an entire persona for survival. You often forget where the mask ends.  
  People think you're fine. You aren’t.

- **🫣 Adaptive Masker:**  
  You shift based on who you’re with. You unmask in pieces.  
  You dream of being fully seen, but safety’s still conditional.

- **🫡 Raw Signal:**  
  You barely mask anymore—or never could. You either repel or magnetize.  
  You’re *done* hiding. Even if it costs you comfort.
