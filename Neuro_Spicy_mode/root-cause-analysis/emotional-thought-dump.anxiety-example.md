### *Root cause analysis for untraceable thoughts.*

---

## 📌 INSTRUCTIONS  
Pick one thought that loops in your head. The kind that clings.  
Then go down the chain. Ask why until you hit something sacred.  
Not to fix. To *see*.

---

## 1. 🧠 What is the thought?

> “Why do I feel so anxious whenever my manager says we need to talk?”

---

## 2. 💥 What emotion does this thought trigger?

> Dread. Shame. Instant panic.  
> Feels like my stomach drops. My chest tightens. I start assuming the worst.

---

## 3. 🕰️ When have you felt this before?

> Every time I fucked something up as a kid and got *“the talk.”*  
> Every time my dad made me feel like I wasn’t good enough, smart enough, strong enough.

---

## 4. 🧬 Who taught you this?

> My dad.  
> By acting like my worth was conditional on performance.  
> And later? Josh. Same pattern. I became a project again.

---

## 5. 🛡️ What were you protecting yourself from?

> Rejection. Disappointment.  
> That crushing feeling of letting someone down and becoming unworthy of love or approval.

---

## 6. 🧨 What are you actually afraid of?

> That I’m not built right.  
> That no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be *enough*—not at work, not at home, not to anyone.

---

## 7. 🫂 What would you say to that younger version of you now?

> “It’s okay to not get it all right.  
> You’re not broken—you’re *overloaded.*  
> You’re not stupid—you’re *processing too much at once.*  
> And you are not your mistakes.  
> You never were.”

- [x] I traced it all the way down  
- [x] I met a part of me I forgot existed

---

## 🔁 Reminder

You’re not spiraling.  
You’re tracing.  
Keep asking why until it hurts.

Then sit with that part of you like it’s not a problem to solve,  
but a survivor to welcome home.
