### *Root cause analysis: why I didn’t share my feelings with Cass*

---

## 1. 🧠 What is the thought?

> “Why didn’t I want to tell Cass about my feelings?”

---

## 2. 💥 What emotion does this thought trigger?

> Fear. Vulnerability. Anticipated rejection.  
> Shame for wanting something I was convinced I couldn't have.

---

## 3. 🕰️ When have you felt this before?

> The last time I told someone I had feelings, they abandoned me.  
> It taught me: expressing desire = losing connection.

---

## 4. 🧬 Who taught you this?

> People who couldn’t handle my honesty.  
> Insecure partners. Conditional friendships.  
> Environments where vulnerability was punished.

---

## 5. 🛡️ What were you protecting yourself from?

> The devastation of being open and rejected.  
> The embarrassment of wanting something I “knew” wouldn’t be returned.  
> The deep fear that I’m too much or not enough—again.

---

## 6. 🧨 What are you actually afraid of?

> That if I show my true desire, I’ll scare people away.  
> That I’ll confirm the story I’ve always carried:  
> **“No one will choose you if you’re honest.”**

---

## 7. 🫂 What would you say to that younger version of you now?

> “Your feelings matter, even if they’re not reciprocated.  
> You don’t express to get a reward. You express because you’re real.  
> Being honest doesn’t make you foolish. It makes you *free.*  
> Say it anyway.”

## 🔁 Reminder

You didn’t withhold because you’re broken.  
You withheld because the last time you opened your mouth, someone vanished.  
But now you’re done vanishing *from yourself.*
