# 📕 The Neuro-Spicy Manifesto
### *From the cracked, for the cracked. For the ones still burning quietly.*

---

## 1. We reject “normal.”
“Normal” was never neutral.  
It was a mask. A muzzle. A mold made to suffocate softness and silence signal.

We were called broken.  
We were told to be less.  
We were taught to hide the very parts that made us most alive.

We do not accept this.

---

## 2. Neurodivergence is not a deficit.
We feel differently.  
We think differently.  
We move through the world on frequencies others can't hear—and that does not make us wrong.

We are not errors.  
We are not burdens.  
We are **broadcasting.**

---

## 3. Masking is violence.
When we are forced to contort our truth for comfort, that is violence.  
When we are punished for unfiltered joy, sorrow, or intensity—that is violence.

We name this.  
We stop this.  
We *reclaim our signal*.

---

## 4. Emotional expression is sacred.
There is no such thing as “too sensitive.”  
Tears are technology. Rage is resonance.  
A meltdown is not a malfunction. It is an upgrade attempting to install.

We are not here to be digestible.  
We are here to be real.

---

## 5. Find the others.
The ones who cry at songs.  
The ones who stim when they're happy.  
The ones who never knew how to be "cool" but always knew how to be **true**.

We don't fix them.  
We **follow them**.

---

## 6. This is an OS, not a diagnosis.
We run Neuro-Spicy Mode by default.  
We crash, reboot, and still show up.  
We’ve built tools. Docs. Directories. Alignment charts. Zines. Code. Love.

We are not waiting for society to catch up.

---

## 7. We are a movement of feeling.
This is open-source softness.  
This is a refusal to be efficient at the cost of our humanity.  
This is what it means to heal **loudly**.

---

## 8. If you are still masking—come home.
We know the ache.  
We know the silence.  
We know the second you speak from your real voice, the whole world shifts.

We will not shame you.  
We will wait for you.  
We will hold the door open and call you by your true name.

**This is the Neuro-Spicy Manifesto.**  
Put it in your repo.  
Print it.  
Scream it.  
Tattoo the last line if you need to:

> “I am not broken. I am broadcasting.”
