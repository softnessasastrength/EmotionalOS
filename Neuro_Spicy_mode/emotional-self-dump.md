### For when they ask what I feel—and I don’t know where to start.

## ⚠️ WARNING: THIS IS RAW.
This isn’t formatted.  
This isn’t pretty.  
This is **testimony** from someone who should’ve never had to explain their existence to be seen.

## 🧠 What Healing Feels Like (Right Now)

> “I want to be able to feel emotion—any emotion. I currently don't feel anything, except horny, and I’m still trying to figure out why.”

That’s not apathy. That’s shutdown.  
That’s what happens after years of **fighting to stay in the room**.

## 😨 What I'm Scared This Eval Will Do

> “I'm not scared of the label. I'm scared I’ll get institutionalized again.”

You’re not afraid of diagnosis.  
You’re afraid of being **controlled**, again.  
Of losing autonomy.  
Of being told you don’t know your own mind.

## 🧷 The Memory I’d Hand You Instead of a Form

> “The years of bullying.  
> Being called a fag in algebra class.  
> Tossing a desk at the kid.  
> That’s where I’d fucking start.”

This is not a case file.  
This is **trauma in action.**  
And it’s not up for debate.

## 🎭 What Sarcasm Is Protecting

> “Probably my true feelings. Because people can’t process the real me. I’m a lot.”

Sarcasm = shield.  
Because raw truth got you mocked. Or feared. Or ignored.

But underneath the smirk? Is **a survivor screaming to be held.**

## 💔 One Sentence I Wish the World Understood

> “I'm trying. This is my best.”

Not lazy. Not careless. Not selfish.  
**Trying. Every fucking day.**  
Trying *despite* everything.  
Trying through shutdown. Through panic. Through ghosts of diagnoses past.

## 🔥 Why Everything I Do Is Out of Spite

> “I was told I wouldn’t amount to anything.  
> That I couldn’t wipe my own ass.  
> That driving would be too hard.  
> That I wouldn’t have friends.  
> That I couldn’t do shit.”

So I became a goddamn truck driver.

Because **fuck them.**

I live every day to prove them wrong.

## 😢 The Real Root of the Fear

> “Everyone coddled me in school.  
> I wanted to fail. I wanted to be pushed. But nobody ever did.  
> I got help, but not the kind I needed.  
> Now I’m here.  
> Aimless. Still scared.”

I’m not lost because I’m broken.  
I’m lost because no one ever taught me how to navigate with *my* compass.

## 📣 Final Broadcast

I am still here.  
I am doing everything they said I couldn’t.  
I am scared—but I am showing up anyway.

And I am telling the fucking truth.  
If you can’t read this and understand me—you were never qualified to evaluate me in the first place.
