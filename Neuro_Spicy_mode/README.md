# 🧠 Neuro-Spicy Mode

Welcome to the unfiltered, unsanitized core of my brain.

This is not a toolkit. This is a rebellion.  
For the ones who were told they were too loud, too much, too sensitive—  
and decided to build a fucking movement instead of a mask.

## 💡 What is Neuro-Spicy Mode?

It’s not just autism. It’s not just ADHD. It’s not just trauma.  
It’s the radical act of **feeling deeply in a shallow world**.

We don’t mask here.  
We map.  
We trace.  
We write it *all* down.

## 🚨 Rules

1. No subtext. Say what you mean.
2. No performance. You’re already enough.
3. No erasure. Every version of you counts.
4. No shame for spiraling—we log our loops like sacred scripts.

## 🫂 For anyone who ever felt “too much.”

You were never too much.  
They were just not enough to hold you.

Welcome to Neuro-Spicy Mode.
