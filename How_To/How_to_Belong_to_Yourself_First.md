# How to Belong to Yourself First

1. Sit alone, not as punishment—but as ritual.
2. Speak your truths aloud. Let them echo back.
3. Wear your softness like armor.
4. Make peace with your contradictions.
5. Accept your whole, weird, evolving self.

You’re not looking for a place. You’re becoming one.
