# How to Let Go Without Hating

1. Feel the anger first. Don’t pretend you’re above it.
2. Hate is just hurt in armor—strip it down.
3. Let go for *you*, not for them.
4. Release the fantasy of closure.
5. Speak the goodbye out loud—even if they never hear it.

Letting go doesn’t mean forgetting. It means *freeing yourself*.
