# How to Feel Without Spinning Out

1. Ground first. Touch something real—your body, the floor, the now.
2. Speak it out. Emotions that stay in echo louder.
3. Ask: “Is this feeling *now*, or is it *old*?”
4. Break the loop. Cold water. Music. Movement.
5. Let it peak, then pass. You’re not the emotion. You’re its observer.

Feeling deeply doesn’t mean losing control. It means finding your *center*.
