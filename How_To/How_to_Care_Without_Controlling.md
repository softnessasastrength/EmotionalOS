# How to Care Without Controlling

1. Ask if they want help—don’t assume.
2. Let them choose—even if it’s messy.
3. Support without scripting their outcome.
4. Check your ego. Helping isn’t about being needed.
5. Trust their process. Let them fall. Be their *net*, not their *puppet master*.

Care should feel like freedom, not a leash.
