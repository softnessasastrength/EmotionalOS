# How to Be Held When You’re Not Used to It

1. Start small. Ask first. Trust slowly.
2. Let your body be awkward. That’s part of the thaw.
3. Breathe. Inhale safety. Exhale shame.
4. Don’t perform calm. Be *real*.
5. Say thank you—even if your voice shakes.

Being held is terrifying *because it works*.
