# How to Grieve When They’re Still Alive

1. Name the loss—don’t gaslight yourself.
2. Let it hurt. You’re not weak for missing someone who’s still breathing.
3. Grieve the future you imagined with them.
4. Create ritual. Burn the letter. Cry to the playlist.
5. Don’t wait for closure. Grieve without permission.

Grief doesn’t wait for death. It waits for *honesty*.
