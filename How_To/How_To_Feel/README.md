# How_To_Feel

This folder is your emotional field manual.

Each file is a guide—a path through the fog, written in real time by someone who's felt it all and lived to log it.

## Why These Exist

Because nobody taught us how to feel.  
Because emotional literacy wasn’t in the curriculum.  
Because we learned survival, not surrender.

This folder rewrites that script.
