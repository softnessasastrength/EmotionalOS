# How to Let Someone See You

1. Stop curating. Start confessing.
2. Say what’s true—even if it’s ugly.
3. Watch their response. That’s your mirror.
4. Stay in the room after you reveal. That’s the growth.
5. If they see you and stay? That’s your *people*.

Being seen is risky. But being hidden is *suffocating*.
