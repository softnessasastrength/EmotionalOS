# How to Let Go When They Don’t Want You

1. Stop begging. That’s not love—it’s fear of absence.
2. Grieve the story you built around them.
3. Remember who you were before they arrived.
4. Redirect your love inward. Fiercely.
5. Let their disinterest be your redirection.

You’re not hard to love. You’re just not for them.
