# How to Crash and Not Die

For the moments where the OS bluescreens. Here's your emotional reboot protocol.

- Step 1: Don’t isolate. Text **one person** with: “I’m not okay. Just needed someone to know.”
- Step 2: Touch something real. The ground. A wall. Your own chest.
- Step 3: Say out loud: *“I made it through worse. This is not the end.”*
- Step 4: Sleep like your body is a server that needs to cool down.
