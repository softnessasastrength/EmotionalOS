# How to Ask for Affection

1. Get clear on what you want—touch, words, closeness?
2. Ask directly. “Can I have a hug?” is a full sentence.
3. If you’re scared, say that too. “This is hard to ask for…”
4. Accept their answer—yes or no—with grace.
5. Celebrate asking. That’s the real courage.

Affection isn’t weakness. It’s *nourishment*.
