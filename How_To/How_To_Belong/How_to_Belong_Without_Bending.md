# How to Belong Without Bending

1. Don’t contort. Contours are meant to clash.
2. Belonging starts when you *show up unchanged*.
3. If you’re accepted only when you shrink—it’s not belonging.
4. Speak your language. The right people will hear you.
5. Build the table if you’re tired of asking for a seat.

True belonging is when you bring *all of you*, and they stay.
