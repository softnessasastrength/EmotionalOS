# How to Love Without Owning

1. See them as whole—not a piece of your puzzle.
2. Stop measuring how much they give back.
3. Give freely. Expect clearly. Attach loosely.
4. If they change, love their evolution—not your idea of them.
5. Let them go when needed. Love isn’t a leash.

If it has to be caged, it was never love. It was fear.
