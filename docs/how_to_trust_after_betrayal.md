# How to Trust After Betrayal

1. Accept that rebuilding trust is a choice, not a default.
2. Name your fears without letting them rule you.
3. Practice micro-trust with safe people first.
4. Reframe trust as a gift you give, not a guarantee you demand.
5. Trust yourself most of all to survive whatever happens next.
