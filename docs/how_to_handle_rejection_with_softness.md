# How to Handle Rejection with Softness

1. Accept that rejection reflects circumstance, not your worth.
2. Meet rejection with curiosity, not anger.
3. Allow yourself to feel disappointment without hardening.
4. Maintain open-heartedness without clinging to approval.
5. Celebrate every soft 'no' as proof of your courage to try.
