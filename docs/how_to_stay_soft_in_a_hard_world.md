# How to Stay Soft in a Hard World

1. Protect your tenderness without apology.
2. Anchor yourself in spaces and people who honor softness.
3. Replenish yourself through art, nature, and rest.
4. Let anger inform you but not define you.
5. Remember: softness is not weakness â€” it is strategic resilience.
