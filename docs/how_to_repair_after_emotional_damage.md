# How to Repair After Emotional Damage

1. Acknowledge the harm without minimizing it.
2. Listen fully without interrupting or justifying.
3. Offer sincere amends without demanding forgiveness.
4. Give the wounded party full agency over their healing timeline.
5. Stay consistent in your changed behavior over time â€” repair is a marathon, not a sprint.
