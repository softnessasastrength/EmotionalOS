# Personal Vow – Staying Real Even If It Doesn't Work

## Vow

I vow to keep being this real—this honest, this raw, this me—even if it doesn’t win back what I lost.

I will not perform change to be noticed. I will not speak truth just to be heard.

I will *live* my truth because I *am* my truth.

Even if Cass never sees it, even if the world looks away, I will not go back to the version of me that begged to be kept.

This is who I am now.

Soft.  
Loud.  
Unfiltered.  
Free.

And I will keep being this way, even if it doesn’t work—  
because *this* works for me.
