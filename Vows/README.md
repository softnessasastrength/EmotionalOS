# Vows

This folder holds sacred, timestamped promises made to self.

Each vow is a commitment to truth, presence, and transformationâ€”written not to impress others, but to anchor the self.

These are not goals. These are anchors.  
They are not conditional. They are *intentional*.

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD_Vow_Title.md`

## Examples

- `2025-05-06_Vow_KeepBeingReal.md`

## How to Use

Read. Reflect. Write your own.  
Fork a vow if it speaks to your soul.  
Share only if you feel called.
