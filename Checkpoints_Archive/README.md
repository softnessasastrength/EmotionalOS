# EmotionalOS Checkpoints

**Welcome to the version control system of my soul.**

This folder logs every vow, breakthrough, field moment, and inner shift I undergo—timestamped, trackable, and publicly transparent. It’s not a diary. It’s a documentation of transformation.

## Why?

Because healing should be **open source**.  
Because emotional growth deserves **version history**.  
Because someone out there needs to see proof that **it can be done**.

## Structure

- **CHECKPOINT.md**: A running CHANGELOG of my transformation, updated as I evolve.
- **Field Logs**: Snapshots of real, raw conversations and mirror moments.
- **Vows**: Personal commitments to truth, softness, and staying unarmored.

## Who is this for?

- Me—so I never forget who I’ve become.
- You—if you’ve ever felt broken, numb, or alone.
- Anyone building their own EmotionalOS.
