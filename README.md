🚀 Why v2.0 Matters

The world wasn’t built for emotional safety.
EmotionalOS wasn’t built by the world.
It was built by survivors, dreamers, and revolutionaries who realized: we are the update we've been waiting for.

Version 2.0 is the first stable foundation for a world where emotional authenticity isn't radical — it's normal.
📢 Installation Instructions

    No download required (optional zip available for nerds).
    The true install happens when you:

    Read a guide

    Override fear in one tiny moment

    Laugh through pain instead of closing off

    Tell the truth about your heart when it would be easier to lie

That's the install process.
No reboot required.
Welcome home.
