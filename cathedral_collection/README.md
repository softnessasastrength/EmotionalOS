# The Cathedral Collection

**Built from fire. Written in scars. Offered with open hands.**

## What is this?

The Cathedral Collection is a series of emotional field guides, poems, and manifestos forged from real heartbreak, healing, and sovereignty.

It is the story of a man who stopped waiting to be saved — and instead built his own cathedral.

This is not a cry for help.  
This is not a conquest.  
This is a sanctuary.
