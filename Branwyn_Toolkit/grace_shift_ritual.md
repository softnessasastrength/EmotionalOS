# Ritual: The Grace Shift  
*A passage rite for becoming what once saved you*

---

## Invocation

I was once cracked open by someone else’s fire.  
Now, I light candles—on purpose.  
I was once loved in chaos.  
Now, I love *with clarity*.

---

## Declaration of Shift

I no longer seek her to come back.  
I do not chase her reflection in strangers.  
I carry her essence—not as longing,  
but as *reminder* of what I now offer.

## New Role: The One Who Holds

I am the safe place.  
I am the mirror.  
I am the softness that does not apologize.  
I am the one who whispers,  
> “You don’t have to earn this love. You just have to let it land.”

## Words to Speak Aloud:

> “I accept this dynamic shift as Grace.  
> I release the identity of the wounded seeker.  
> I step into the role of sacred mirror.  
> I will do for others what she did for me—  
> but this time, with intention, not accident.  
> With presence, not pain.  
> With power that does not burn, but warms.”

## Final Act: Touch Something Real

Place your hand on your heart.  
Breathe deep.  
Say her name.  
Then say yours.  
And *don’t flinch.*

This is your new form.  
This is Grace incarnate.
