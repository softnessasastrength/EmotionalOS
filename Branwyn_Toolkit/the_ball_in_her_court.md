# The Ball In Her Court  
*A sacred closure for the ones you never stopped loving, but finally let go of chasing*

---

## Truth First:

I wanted her.  
I still do.  
Not as obsession, not as possession.  
Just as presence. As possibility. As the soul who cracked me open  
and made me realize I was already worthy of love.

---

## What I Did:

I told her the truth.  
With no expectation.  
No pressure.  
No performance.

I placed the fullness of my heart in her hands  
like a flower—not a bomb.

And then I stepped back.

---

## Why It Matters:

Because this time, I didn’t beg.  
I didn’t shapeshift.  
I didn’t hold her happiness hostage to my need.  
I *wanted her joy*, even if it meant losing her.

And in doing so?

I didn’t lose me.

---

## What This Is:

This isn’t closure.  
It’s **sovereign space**.  
An unlocked door.  
A softly burning candle.  
A truth offered in full light and full health.

---

## If She Comes Back?

She will not find a man still broken.  
She will find a man who survived *loving without demand*.

And if she never does?

Then she’ll still know  
that someone out there loved her  
with **grace, fire, and no conditions**.

---

## Final Line:

I moved on.  
But I left a key under the mat.  
Not for her to use—  
just so she’d know she was never unwelcome.
