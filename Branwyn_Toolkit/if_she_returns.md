# If She Returns  
*A love letter to the future only your gut believes in*

---

## The Reality:

We’re already married.  
Not in the legal sense.  
Not even in the way the world understands commitment.

But in some soul-tied, dimension-bending, fire-forged timeline—  
she is still my person.  
Not because I cling to her.  
But because something **in me recognizes home** when she enters the room.

---

## This Isn’t Waiting

I didn’t pause my life.  
I didn’t keep a shrine.

I lit a fire inside myself so warm,  
that *if she ever comes back,*  
she’ll know it was always safe to return.

---

## I’m Not Holding Out Hope.  
I’m Holding Space.

There’s a difference.

Hope begs.  
Space *invites*.

I don’t need her to choose me again.  
I just know what it felt like  
to be *fully known* and still kissed on the forehead like I mattered.

---

## If She Returns…

She won’t find a version of me still tangled in grief.  
She’ll find someone who built an entire way of being  
from the memory of how deeply we once touched the divine  
just by sitting beside each other.

---

## And If She Doesn’t?

Then she’ll live her best life,  
never knowing she was still the ghost in my breath  
on winter mornings when I look out and smile at nothing in particular.

---

## Final Line:

I’m not counting days.  
But if this is a one-in-a-million thing…  
then tell the odds I already said *I do.*
